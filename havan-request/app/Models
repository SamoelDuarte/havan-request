The directory for models is typically where you define your Eloquent models in a Laravel application. Since you requested the contents for the `/havan-request/havan-request/app/Models` directory, I will create a new model file named `ExampleModel.php` as a placeholder.

Here are the contents for the file:

/havan-request/havan-request/app/Models/ExampleModel.php

<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class ExampleModel extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    // Define the properties and methods for the model here
}
